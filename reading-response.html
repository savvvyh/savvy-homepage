        J.R. Carpenter Reading Response
    </h1>
I really like what they’re saying about coding by hand as an act of resistance to commercialized web. I feel like one of the things that makes me so afraid of doing anything web-based is the sheer abundance of super processed and polished web-based materials that’s out there, that we’re consuming everyday.
