    One of their main points that I took away was looking at computers through a humanist lens. I like how the author keeps referring back to the “mythology” of the origin of computation, and how they bring attention to figures other than Steve Jobs and how they talk about how the first computers were mostly women. I’d never really considered how militarization financed the industry. I’m really enjoying reading different perspectives on web-based material, and the emphasis on breaking them down and figuring out that they can be handmade.
