        The Internet's Back to the Land Movement
    </h1>
    I’ve never really thought of the internet or data as taking up physical space, I’ve always just thought of the cloud as a magical place but thinking about how many real earth acres these data centers take up is so so scary. Big tech conglomerates like Google like to market their web spaces as free and unlimited, but there’s really not a way to have it all without sacrificing anything (privacy, personal data, money, etc.) “ As we come to realize that even our digital growth has its limits, we’re once again faced with a choice: stay within the strictures of existing structures, or go off-grid and build our own.”
