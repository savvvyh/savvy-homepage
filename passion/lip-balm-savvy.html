        <h2>Naturium Phyto-glow Lip Balm</h2>
        <body>
    <p>My lip balm of the week is the Naturium Phyto-Glow Lip Balm in the shade petal (it was the only one left at Target). Overall, I'd give this one an 8/10 because it is</p>
          <ul> 
            <li>very moisturizing</li>
            <li>glossy</li>
            <li>a pretty color</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
         but oh my god it is so thick!! Maybe I'm just getting spoiled by all of the lip oils on the market but it is a sensory nightmare jesus christ. Also the applicator is strange, for a product so thick I feel like a doe foot would lend itslef better to the product than the flat plastic head, which kind of just scrapes the product off.</p>

        <h2>Tonymoly Jelly Lip Melt</h2>
        <body>
          <p>This week my lip product has been the Tonymoly jelly, and it's one of my favorites! It has a really nice consistency, it's super thick and jiggly and I really want to eat it. It has a really nice fruity floral scent and I have the purple color, which is subtle but looks nice. My favorite thing about this one is how moisturizing it is. I feel like I really notice a difference in how dry my lips are once this product has come off. Since it's so thick, it lasts quite a while and doesn't leave that weird rubbery feeling after a while. I brought this with me and wore it on a plane, which I feel like is a good indicator of how much I like this product. 9.5/10 for this one!</p>

        <h2>NYX Fat Lip Oil</h2>
        <body>
          <p>The NYX Fat Lip Oil in shade Status Update is my lippie of the week! TBH I only grabbed this one because it was in the bottom of my girlfriend's purse and my lips were so dry it was making me tweak. I think this gloss is nice, it's shiny, it's a nice color, and it was the only one available to me. It's dependable, but nothing super special. The color is pretty, and when these first came out I loved them and bought one in every single color. But now I'm not getting excited to use them anymore. 6/10</p>
        <p>TL;DR:</p>
          <ul> 
            <li>nice colors</li>
            <li>big applicator</li>
            <li>old news</li>
